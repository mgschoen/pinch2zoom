        <p>When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” This design is fucking brilliant.</p>
        <p>Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. Form follows fucking function. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else?</p>

        <p>While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Fuck. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think.</p>
        <p>To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Respect your fucking craft.

        <p>A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design.

The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think.</p>
        <p>Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning.</p>
        <p>Form follows fucking function. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough.</p>
        <p>The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. This design is fucking brilliant. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography.</p>

If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Use your fucking hands. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. You are not your fucking work.</p>
        <p>Use your fucking hands. Use your fucking hands. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old.</p>
